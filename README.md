# The-Graph

This program utilizes Map and Linked List ADT to implement a weighted, directed Graph ADT to store the relationship between vertices V and their edges E. The data of V and E is imported from a single CSV file (a list of cities and their connections). the Graph ADT is able to perform the following functionalities:

- Insert a vertex if it is not already present
- Adds a connection between two vertices if one does not yet exist
- Resets the graph to an empty state
- Reports if a vertex is stored within the graph
- Removes a specified edge, if it exists
- Identifies if a path exists between two vertices
- Provides a collection of neighboring vertices of a target vertex
- Remove a vertex and all edges connected to that vertex
- Find the shortest path between two vertices (using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm)
